Standalone T-Shirt Product Search Program
------------------------------------------

The Standalone T-Shirt Product Search Program is a Java application designed to assist users in finding T-shirts from popular brands like Nike, Puma, and Adidas. The program utilizes CSV files containing T-shirt data for each brand, which can be easily extended to include more data or additional CSV files for other companies. The program takes four input parameters: Color, Size, Gender, and Output Preference, enabling users to customize their search based on their specific preferences.

Key Features:

1.CSV Data Source: The program reads and parses T-shirt data from three CSV files, one for each brand (Nike, Puma, and Adidas). The CSV files contain information such as product names, colors, sizes, genders, prices, and ratings.

2.User Input: Upon execution, the program prompts the user to input the desired T-shirt attributes:
a. Color: The user can specify the preferred color of the T-shirt (e.g., "Red," "Blue," "Black," etc.).
b. Size: The user can select the desired size of the T-shirt (e.g., "Small," "Medium," "Large," etc.).
c. Gender: The user can choose between "M" for male and "F" for female, indicating the intended gender of the T-shirt.
d. Output Preference: The user can define the sorting order for the search results based on "Price," "Rating," or "Both Price and Rating."

3.Matching Products: The program filters the available T-shirt data based on the user's input criteria and presents a list of matching products that meet the specified color, size, and gender requirements.

4.Sorting Options: Depending on the user's preference, the search results can be sorted by "Price," "Rating," or both "Price and Rating." This allows users to prioritize products based on their budget or quality preferences.

5.Extensibility: The program is designed to be easily extendable to include additional CSV files for more brands or T-shirt data. This ensures that new companies or products can be seamlessly incorporated into the search system.

6.Error Handling: The program includes robust error handling to handle unexpected inputs and provide helpful error messages to guide users in case of invalid or incorrect inputs.

7.User-Friendly Interface: The program offers a simple and intuitive command-line interface, making it accessible and straightforward for users to interact with.
